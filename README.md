# rct.github.io
rct's public pages via rct.github.io

This is the source repo. To view the pages goto: [https://rct.github.io/](https://rct.github.io/)

The top level page is in [index.md](index.hmd).   You are currently viewing [README.md](README.md), which has info about the repo, rather than stuff to show on github.io.

To Do
* Theme/templates?
* Jekyll vs Awestruct vs ???
* Bootstrap, PatternFly, etc.?
* Try adding some sample (but static) Bootstrap and/or Patternfly pages.
* Add pointers to various repos that I use.
