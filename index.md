# rct.github.io
rct's public pages via rct.github.io.  

There isn't much here ... yet. I still need figure out the relative merits of maintaining a site in markdown using a static site generator like Jekyll or Awestruct vs. the simplicity of using Github's built in wiki.

## Github content

Not much personal stuff here yet. 

* [Jupyter Notebook Samples](https://rct.github.io/jupyter-samples)

## Links
* [rct's notes blog](https://rctnotes.blogspot.com/)
* [Wiki on github](https://github.com/rct/rct.github.io/wiki) - not much there yet
* [source repo](https://github.com/rct/rct.github.io/) for these pages on github.


## To Do
* Theme/templates?
* Jekyll vs Awestruct vs ???
* Bootstrap, PatternFly, etc.?
* Try adding some sample (but static) Bootstrap and/or Patternfly pages.
* Add pointers to various repos that I use.
